                    <p>he answer arrived in his mailbox early one morning in Edwardsburg, Michigan. The small UPS package held Robby Walker’s chance at a life outside his bedroom.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the basement of his parent’s house, Robby cut open the box, his latest shipment from NewMind, and reached inside. In his palm he held a clear plastic bag with .25 grams of pale yellow powder. It was amfonelic acid, or AFA. It was supposed to boost dopamine levels, which would help his depression. It was supposed to be safe, with no risk of addiction and no adverse side effects. .
                    </p>
                    <p>Using a diamond scale Robby measured out 1 milligram of AFA. He carefully tapped the powder into an empty gel capsule and took his first dose. No observable adverse reaction. He felt fine. The next day, he took 10 times as much. </p>
                    <p>AFA was the newest addition to his self-prescribed daily regimen: 200 milligrams of tianeptine twice a day, Noopept in the morning, 100 milligrams of phenethylamine as needed and 450 mg of phenibut before bed. And that was in addition to the Zoloft and Klonopin prescribed by his doctor. They helped reduce Robby’s relentless anxiety and inescapable depression–they’d even helped him quit his habit of amphetamine and opioid abuse, curbing his cravings. In Robby’s mind nootropics were his last chance at a normal life.</p>
                    <p>This custom cocktail of substances—collectively called nootropics—helped Robby take control of his life. He could hold a steady job. He did sweet things for his fiancé, Jaime, like making her dinner and rubbing her feet after a long day. He saw a side of himself that depression and anxiety kept hidden—the Robby that was relaxed, thoughtful, engaging and funny. He even had enough energy to pick up his drumsticks and to play the guitar again.</p>
                    <p>But his depression persisted. After a few days, Robby doubled his dosage of AFA, trying to find the perfect balance. He didn’t notice any negative side effects, but Jaime saw how it changed him. He made wild hand gestures. His heart raced. His speech was rapid-fire. </p>
                    <p>Still unsatisfied, Robby pushed for more. He upped the dosage to 60 milligrams of AFA that week, and then again to 80 milligrams. He ordered another gram of AFA, setting him back 150 dollars. Robby started sleeping less, maybe three hours a night. But he wasn’t concerned–he was a night owl anyway.</p>

                    <p>Then one night in bed, Robby heard it. Beep. It was soft and quick, a tiny prick in his ears. Beep. He heard it again. Was he really alone in the basement? Beep. It was coming from the locked storage closet near his bed. It was the perfect place for someone to hide.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since beginning the AFA regiment about a month prior, Robby’s mother, TJ, noticed a change in her son’s demeanor. His anxiety, which normally made him a bit of a recluse, had given way to enthusiasm and impassioned speech. Curious, Robby’s father, Robert, wanted to try some–Robby had told him these supplements were safe. He wanted to see if the substance would boost his memory. Within minutes of swallowing the pill, his heart began to race. He felt euphoric. The sensation lasted only a few hours, but over the next few days, he felt terrible. He had strange pinches of pain on different parts of his body. This was clearly not a “vitamin for the mind.”</p>
                    <p>Robby didn’t want to hurt his parents. Why had his father reacted like that to the AFA? His parents were going to get back at him for this. They weren’t going to let this go. He couldn’t sleep, imagining the tricks they were planning. Then Robby remembered the closet. Beep. His family must have hidden his brother, Zach, in the closet as a prank. It was obvious that they had flown him up from Florida to jump out of the closet and scare him. That was it. It was just a matter of time. </p>
                    <p>He confided in Jaime. “You know that my brother is hiding in the basement closet, right?”</p>

                    <p>Jaime and TJ tried to tell Robby that the closet was safe. They unlocked the door to show him its contents: items from his parents’ old pawn shop, including some boxes of old watches. Beep. They all heard it. It was just the sound of batteries dying. Zach was never there.</p>
                    <p>Robby was nauseous, unable to eat or drink. He started to say peculiar things. When Jaime would ask if he wanted the window open, he couldn’t answer. She could see his eyes darting, as if his brain was fighting to figure something out. Robby was afraid. He didn’t want to open the window because of the people under the bed. The only thing Jaime could do was show him it wasn’t true. She got on her knees and crawled under the bed. There was nothing.</p>
                    <p>But someone was inside the wall, he knew it. Beeping, scratching, monitoring, watching. Government researchers were observing him. It was clear they had tracked his use of AFA. Beep. There it was again, gnawing at his brain. If he went to sleep, he’d wake up somewhere different. Beep. They needed to put wires and implants and devices in his brain. Beep. They were coming to get him.</p>

                    <p>People using nootropics liken it to bodybuilding for the brain. Just like bodybuilders might take protein powder or workout pills in hopes of building muscle and burning fat, users take nootropics to boost the performance of memory and productivity. At the right combination, they say, nootropics give your brain an edge.</p>
                    <p>But unlike protein powders or workout pills, nootropics fall into a legal gray area that makes a proper definition hard to pin down. They can include unregulated compounds, unapproved pharmaceutical products, and supplements. Some are organic and readily found in nature; others are synthetic, laboratory-created substances. And though each substance has its own nuances and particulars, what unites all nootropics is the promise they hold for users: the ability to help you think more clearly and recollect in greater detail. </p>
                    <p>The market lives primarily online, where Robby and other users purchase various substances from specialty vendors, typically in powder form. Users measure out the individual dosage with tiny scoops and combine the ingredients in gel capsules, or sometimes mix the powder with water. For those seeking the brain boost without the hassle, some companies have created their own blends–all-in-one type pills that remove the guesswork of determining the best ingredients for an individual “stack,” or custom blend of compounds.</p>
                    <p>That’s how users describe their personal selection of nootropics. They mix and match substances for specific, targeted effects. Some want to be one step ahead of their competition, looking for fixes beyond a cup of coffee or energy drink. Others even use nootropics to alleviate depression, like Robby, or to cure hangovers.</p>
                    <p>Of course the quest for self-improvement is nothing new. In Genesis, Eve ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge in spite of the consequences. In Greek mythology, mortals sought after the strength of mind and body of the gods. Alchemists of antiquity mixed potions and concocted metals to create cure-alls and prolong life. European explorers conquered the New World in the hopes of discovering the Fountain of Youth.</p>
                    <p>Nootropics, then, fit squarely within that framework, applying a kind of a futuristic approach. Nootropics are sometimes called a biohack. By applying a DIY, hacker-style mentality to human biology, biohackers use various tools and technologies to improve their mental and bodily functioning. Not all biohackers use or buy into the hype surrounding nootropics, but adherents to both are united by a spirit of experimentation, or figuring out what’s successful and what isn’t by using their own bodies as research tools.</p>

                    <p>Each individual user’s motivation and intention is different, but at the core, it’s all centered around improving the brain’s performance. It makes sense, then, that users of nootropics skew young—many are college students seeking a boost to help with overpacked schedules that include full course loads, unpaid internships and extracurriculars.</p>
                    <p>Such rigors have created a demand for the prescription drugs Adderall and Ritalin, which in recent years, have gained traction among those without ADHD, using the drugs for their purported performance boost. Advocates of nootropics claim that they lack the adverse side effects of these so-called smart drugs. And that’s partially what makes them so alluring–that you can be more productive and focused without the burn-out or racing heartbeat or crash of stimulants.</p>
                    <p>Nootropics have also found a home in Silicon Valley, where the quest for success drives the start-up culture and tech industry. Geoffrey Woo, co-founder of Nootrobox, a mail-order nootropic company that offers monthly supplies of its products, says that his clientele consists of mostly young men in urban locations, namely San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. Jimmy Kenny, founder of Nootropics City, says that his customers also tend to be men between the ages of 18-34 that are invested in the science behind nootropics–think chemistry majors.</p>
                    <p>The nootropic conversation takes place online, mostly at different forums, including the Nootropics sub-Reddit, Bluelight and Longecity. The Nootropics sub-Reddit, or r/Nootropics, has over 53,000 subscribers. The beginner’s guide post on the sub-Reddit explains roughly 30 different nootropic agents. It also includes instructions on how to measure powders, what to consider before taking anything new and a list of reliable and blacklisted suppliers of nootropics.</p>
                    <p>The conversation was so active on r/Nootropics that another sub-Reddit, r/StackAdvice, was created to handle the traffic. On r/StackAdvice, users are quick to share positive outcomes of products that produce desired effects, or warn against mixing certain nootropics.</p>
                    <p>Ever curious, users of nootropics aren’t taking the science lightly. They’re searching for different substances on PubMed, a compendium of scientific literature, to see what’s out there, but they’re also using both quantitative and qualitative measures, turning to bloggers, nootropic retailers, and other users for advice and personal experiences. Ultimately, they’re experimenting with uncertain substances that could invariably affect their own bodies and minds, for better or for worse.</p>

                    <p>Robby couldn’t function. TJ saw him staring at shadows and reflections trying to figure out if something sinister was behind them. His parents moved him into a bedroom upstairs. For a week, he was lost underwater. He saw faces, but couldn’t hear what they were saying. He wanted to speak, but the words were gone. He had stopped taking all his medication–even the Klonopin and Zoloft. The abrupt change, rather than a slow taper, most likely shocked his system. He struggled to put a coherent thought together. His parents monitored him, taking shifts during the night. Robby went three days without any sleep or much food and water.</p>
                    <p>His dad thought going out for breakfast might help. Robby got in the truck, and Robert behind the wheel. At a stop sign, Robby opened the door and tried to bolt. He was so weak he only made it a few steps. He was convinced his dad was giving him the secret signal to run. Robby’s eyes darted back towards the woods, ready to run again. His dad got out of the car trying not to scare Robby. He took a step forward, placing his arms around Robby’s shoulders making him feel safe. They both quietly got back in the car.</p>
                    <p>Back home, TJ and Robert told Robby they thought it might be time to go to the hospital. They were surprised to hear him quietly agree.</p>
                    <p>As Robby sat on the couch tying his shoes, he looked up at his mother blankly. TJ realized just how serious Robby’s state might be. Would he ever come back from this? What if he were stuck in a permanent psychosis? </p>

                    <p>Struggling to make sense of what had happened, Zach searched for answers in online forums to see if Robby could reverse what had happened. He <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/32ehwv/my_brother_experiencing_full_blown_psychosis/'>posted</a> on Reddit, in r/Nootropics and several other drug-related threads, hoping to find someone who had taken a similar stack.
                    </p>
                    <p>The responses were immediate—and alarming.</p>
                    <p>“This guy clearly has a crazy stack, craziest I’ve ever seen.”</p>
                    <p>“He’s really far into something dark.”</p>
                    <p>“OP, your brother is an addict he needs help.”</p>
                    <p> “He isn’t using nootropics, he’s abusing research chemicals.”</p>
                    <p> “Three words: Self-destructive behavior.”</p>
                    <p>Zach told his mom about the comments on his post. TJ scrolled through the responses, hoping to find advice and suggestions. Instead she found strangers debating her son’s mental health. The remarks forced her to confront what she had always suspected. It woke her up to a truth that she had buried and ignored. But she couldn’t be in denial anymore. Her son was an addict, and these self-experiments were dangerous and informed only by an online community.</p>

                    <p>With nootropics gaining traction and use on the rise, entrepreneurs are taking chances and setting up shop in the nootropic e-commerce space.</p>
                    <p>Take Jimmy Kenny. When Kenny’s brother first clued him into the world of nootropics, he didn’t just see it a panacea–he saw a business opportunity, too. He saw nootropics as a trend on the up-and-up, and sought to carve out an opening in a growing market for the substance.</p>
                    <p>In college at Ohio State, Kenny had studied business. He joined a fraternity, and got into fitness. Every finals week, like clockwork, he’d see students–not just those in Greek life, but everyone–obsessing over Adderall. All his life, he’d known about ADHD–one of his two younger brothers had it–but he never knew much about the types of medication he took to help his symptoms. Kenny researched the basics, and found that Adderall wasn’t the smart drug his peers thought it to be, but that the world of nootropics held promise.</p>
                    <p>Not knowing where to begin, Kenny gathered the resources he had, cashing out his 401K. He took some of his of savings and found a couple of suppliers, at first through Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce platform. He read everything he could, including studies and user reviews. Unwavering in his commitment, Kenny created Nootropics City, an online vendor. </p>
                    <p>“I lost all my pride and dignity so I could do this,” Kenny says. “I was single, I had no obligations, so I could.”</p>
                    <p>The bottom line is that the substances are easy to acquire. With Internet access, a credit card and a shipping address, anyone can buy what’s necessary to create a stack. Some nootropics are clearly labeled, like over-the-counter supplements, others are sold by vendors using undefined terms, like research chemical, in order to skirt liability. Consumers are often required to parse through misleading advertising to find what they consider a reliable source for their desired product.</p>
                    <p>Nootropics that are found in nature, like caffeine, theanine, bacopa, gingko biloba, and milk thistle, are classified and sold as dietary supplements. They’re available over-the-counter, and in many cases, have been used by homeopathic medicine advocates for decades. </p>
                    <p>That doesn’t necessarily make them safer, or more reliable. Companies that manufacture dietary supplements don’t need Food and Drug Administration approval before producing, marketing or selling supplements—though they are required to register their facilities with the agency. And they are legally required to have a disclaimer on all claims. </p>
                    <p>But just because supplements aren’t FDA-approved doesn’t mean they aren’t subject to governmental oversight. Earlier this year, the New York attorney general’s office sent cease and desist letters to GNC, Target, Walgreens and Walmart–major players in the supplement industry–for selling mislabeled supplements. Some supplements, including Target’s gingko biloba and St. John’s wort, herbs used in some nootropic stacks, didn’t even include significant amounts of the herb they claimed to be on the label. Most tested were found to have ingredients not identified on the labels, including allergens and contaminants.</p>

                    <p>“Unlike drugs, supplements are not intended to treat, diagnose, prevent or cure diseases,” says Stephen King of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “That means supplements should not make claims, such as ‘reduces arthritic pain’ or ‘treats heart disease.’” </p>
                    <p>But synthetic nootropics, or those created in laboratories, like piracetam and noopept aren’t currently approved for use in the United States. </p>
                    <p>Piracetam is one of the most common nootropics, and was the first nootropic synthesized by scientist Corneliu E. Giurgea, who coined the term nootropic in the 1960s. The drug isn’t on the market in the United States, but it is prescribed and marketed abroad. Noopept, an analogous drug to piracetam that was in Robby’s daily stack, is sold as a prescription in Russia, but not in the United States. The FDA has issued an import alert for noopept, meaning it can’t be legally imported.</p>
                    <p>But as it turns out, amfonelic acid, the substance that partially triggered Robby’s psychosis, isn’t a nootropic at all–it’s a research chemical, uncontrolled by the FDA for sales or consumption, but used in scientific studies. The term “research chemical” is often used online as code for illicit drugs, like amphetamines or psychoactive drugs, by those seeking to avoid prosecution under U.S. drug law. Many websites that sell nootropics also sell research chemicals, which can be confusing for shoppers like Robby. And it’s that type of ambiguity that makes the nootropics marketplace the new Wild West.</p>

                    <p>“It’s in a legal grey area,” says Mans Denton, founder of Hyperion Strength, a supplement company, who previously owned a nootropics company. “It’s not illegal, but it’s in a strange area. You can’t say supplement, you have to say cognitive enhancer or nootropic–which are undefined terms in any legal sense.”</p>
                    <p>Because many of the products lie outside the scope of FDA regulations, there’s no independent governmental verification of product safety–which can be intimidating for prospective users.</p>
                    <p>As an antidote to skepticism, vendors often self-publish certificates of analysis, or reviews from independently subcontracted laboratories that verify authenticity of product. The r/Nootropics community keeps a running list of independent tests. </p>
                    <p>Such testing may seem suspicious, but according to Lewis Grossman, a professor at American University’s Washington College of Law, third-party independent analysis is a very common trend in food and drug law. Recent amendments to the the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Safety Act even envision third-party verifications for the federal food safety system due to budgetary restrictions facing the agency. Grossman believes challenge in years to come will be to maintain the necessary oversight but utilize third-party, independent certifications and inspections.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately the bottom line is simple: There are major risks that users of these substances must consider. They have to judge whether the supplier is actually selling what they claim to be selling, and whether or not to trust the sourcing. And of course, they have to evaluate what taking that substance means for their health. </p>

                    <p>Do nootropics actually work? It doesn’t look too promising. The science is dubious at best, testing appears to suffer from inherent limitations and a lack of financial incentivization, and few scientists are critically engaging in the subject matter. Many nootropics simply haven’t been tested in the way that most people use them–as a boost rather than a remedy-and the drug interactions are unpredictable.</p>
                    <p>“This has been a much harder question to answer than many advocates assume, in part because of placebo effects,” says Dr. Wayne Hall, professor at the University of Queensland and director at the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research. Beyond that, there’s also limitations with applicability of testing, meaning the tasks performed in lab settings don’t always indicate a change in real-life, day-to-day cognitive functioning.</p>
                    <p>According to Hall, media coverage in recent years has been less critical than he’d like. Hall blamed inaccurate media coverage, at least in part, for the hype surrounding nootropics, cautioning users and journalists alike to adopt a more skeptical outlook. In an editorial in <span class='italic'>Addiction</span>, the scientific journal published by the Society for the Study of Addiction, Hall and his colleague Jayne Lucke conclude, “There is very weak evidence that putatively neuroenhancing pharmaceuticals in fact enhance cognitive function.” </p>
                    <p>With the type of cognitive testing needed to prove that nootropics do work, it’s particularly difficult to measure results. </p>
                    <p>“It is very hard to study long-term effects on memory because it takes a couple years,” says Dr. Jay Z. Yeh, professor emeritus in pharmacology at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “You won’t be able to say, ‘Oh, I take this drug this week, next week my memory becomes better.’ Nothing works like that. It’s hard to evaluate the effectiveness.”</p>
                    <p>There’s also a level of uncertainty associated with the mechanisms at play. </p>
                    <p>“Anybody who says, ‘I know exactly how this drug works this way,’ is sort of blatantly lying to you,” says Dr. Todd Solomon, a clinical neuropsychology fellow at Boston University. </p>
                    <p>And of course, the drugs have yet to be approved in the United States for use. At an FDA Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Meeting in February 2015, Dr. Kenneth Bergmann presented on piracetam, recommending that it not be placed on the list of bulk substances allowed for compounding, or combining or altering with other substances specifically for a patient’s needs. </p>

                    <p>“The majority of these studies suffer from methodological limitations...and lack scientific validity,” said Bergmann. “They’re often insufficiently powered; just a small study, uncontrolled or unblinded.” </p>
                    <p>Even if nootropics prove effective, there’s the ethical question of cognitive enhancement. Off-brand use of or possession without a prescription of Adderall and Ritalin is against the law–not to mention that the drugs are amphetamine-based stimulants, meaning they can be habit-forming. </p>
                    <p>Where exactly cognitive enhancers lie along the spectrum of social acceptance remains to be seen. Supplements like gingko biloba and St. John’s wort have been used for years, but nootropics are still on the ascent and rising to more mainstream prominence–and many don’t know what to make of the drugs.</p>
                    <p>Madeline Kossik, a chemistry student at Northwestern University, represents many college-aged individuals who face temptation from the drug’s promise of increased focus, but are wary of how they will be perceived. </p>
                    <p>“The idea of being able to take a pill and then being able to focus or get your brain to work better, get more work done and understand things better is really tempting,” Kossik says. “Northwestern’s pre-professional, competitive environment probably has something to do with it.”</p>
                    <p>Kossik is not alone in her quest for heightened and directed focus. According to a study conducted by the Food & Drug Administration, Americans ages 14-21 consume an average of 68.45 mg of caffeine per day. Caffeine intake is universally accepted as a way for individuals to stay awake and focused in their work. Nootropics, on the other hand, are an amplified method of extreme focus and understanding, with much less research done on their composition and effects.</p>
                    <p>“If I saw that all of this is harmless, I wouldn’t really care if I were a guinea pig,” Kossik says. “But because they’re so unknown it makes me think twice about buying a bottle.”</p>

                    <p>A thick, blackish-purple sludge moved through Robby’s veins. Doctors couldn’t take his blood at the hospital because of severe dehydration.

                    <p>Robby’s family is open to homeopathic solutions. They tend to shy away from medication, even aspirin, and favor natural remedies when available. And that’s one reason they trusted nootropics. Robby did hours of research on receptors in the brain, investigating neurotransmitters and how each substance reacts in the body. But in taking AFA, he had experimented with an unknown. When his mother conducted her research online, she found very little.</p>
                    <p>“I read things that said you don’t even want to be in the room when the jar is open,” TJ said. “Breathing or touching it could give you a reaction. And that, that was the end of it.”</p>
                    <p>AFA isn’t widely researched, but it is known to be a potent stimulant that increases dopamine in the brain, and that it could be addictive. It’s hard to find anyone outspoken about the positive benefits of AFA use. And many Redditors think it’s dangerous, warning against AFA, arguing that it absolutely shouldn’t be marketed as a nootropic.</p>
                    <p>TJ watched Robby flush the rest of the AFA down the toilet. It was all gone. It was out of their lives–except for the tiny amount Robby had stashed away. A few days after his stay at the hospital, Robby and his mom started to debate whether AFA was really the cause of his psychosis. TJ knew it was dangerous, but Robby wanted to prove his mom wrong. He retrieved the AFA he’d hid and took it–and went into a state of psychosis again. It wasn’t as bad as before, but Robby couldn’t sleep. He was scared to close his eyes. TJ promised him he would be okay, and that she wouldn’t leave him. Robby slept a few hours while his mom stayed up, watching him, worried sick if he’d be able to cross back into reality.</p>

                    <p>TJ still worries about possibly permanent damage, believing it’s still too soon to tell. Robby, meanwhile, is still recovering from everything that’s happened. He still has mild moments of paranoia thoughts and spells of anxiety, but TJ is there to calm him down. He doesn’t live in the basement anymore. He sleeps in his fiance’s room and spends most of the time in the main areas of his family’s house, where he can interact with Jaime–and where TJ can watch him more closely. Robby has started to see an addiction counselor, and TJ monitors all of his medication. But despite all that’s happened, Robby remains optimistic about nootropics. </p>
                    <p>“Nootropics are great. I just made the mistake of not researching enough before I took it,” said Robby.</p>
                    <p>He still takes Zoloft and Klonopin, but has reduced the amount and dosages of nootropics he takes–just phenibut and tianeptine, and at the lowest dose, just few milligrams of each. </p>
                    <p>“You wouldn’t turn teenagers over to a pharmacy and say, ‘Have at it!’” said TJ. “You can’t do that with nootropics either.”
                    </p>
                    <p>But in a sense, that’s exactly what’s happening. Anyone can buy these substances online and get next day shipping. It’s a wide open market with advertising geared towards young adults seeking to jump ahead of everyone else. And though users cit scientific literature, most turn to online forums for advice—which comes from wildly varying self-conducted experiments and individual subjective reports. There is no extensive, long-term data or research on nootropics conducted in the way these Reddit guinea pigs are using them. The scales teeter carefully between dangerous and safe, effective or not. But right now, it’s a growing open source experiment undertaken by anyone with Internet, a credit card and an appetite for unknowable risk.
