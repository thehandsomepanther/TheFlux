That's the question six teams of graduate journalism students asked as they tackled six different cultures and six different economies. The result: Six interactive articles that explore what we pay in money, time, energy, and missed opportunities for every choice we make.</p>

                    <p>he answer arrived in his mailbox early one morning in Edwardsburg, Michigan. The small UPS package held Robby Walker’s chance at a life outside his bedroom.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the basement of his parent’s house, Robby cut open the box, his latest shipment from NewMind, and reached inside. In his palm he held a clear plastic bag with .25 grams of pale yellow powder. It was amfonelic acid, or AFA. It was supposed to boost dopamine levels. It was supposed to be safe, with no risk of addiction and no adverse side effects.</p>
                    <p>Using a diamond scale Robby measured out 1 milligram of amfonelic acid, roughly the weight of an ant. He carefully tapped the powder into an empty gel capsule and took his first dose. No observable adverse reaction. He felt fine. The next day, he increased his dosage to 10 milligrams.</p>
                    <p>AFA was the newest addition to his daily regiment: 200 milligrams of Tianeptine twice a day, Noopept in the morning, 100 milligrams of Phenethylamine as needed and 450 mg of Phenibut before bed. Andl that was in addition to the Zoloft and Klonopin prescribed his doctor. This custom cocktail of substances helped reduce Robby’s relentless anxiety and inescapable depression–they’d even helped him quit his habit of amphetamine and opioid abuse, curbing his cravings.</p>
                    <p>Nootropics helped Robby take control of his life. He could hold a steady job. He did sweet things for his fiancé, Jaime, like making her dinner and rubbing her feet after a long day. They helped draw out a side of Robby his depression and anxiety kept hidden—the Robby that was relaxed, thoughtful, engaging and funny. He even had enough energy to pick up his drumsticks and to play the guitar again.</p>
                    <p>But his depression lingered. After a few days of taking AFA, Robby increased his dose to 20 milligrams. He didn’t notice any negative side effects, but Jaime could see how it was changing him. He made wild hand gestures. His heart raced. His speech was rapid-fire.</p>

                    <p>That week he upped the dosage to 60 milligrams of AFA to test the effects, and then again up to 80 milligrams. He ordered another gram of AFA, setting him back 150 dollars. Robby started sleeping less, maybe three hours a night. But he wasn’t concerned–he was a night owl anyway.</p>
                    <p>One night in bed, Robby heard it. Beep. It was soft and quick, a tiny prick in his ears. Beep. He heard it again. Was he really alone in the basement? Beep. It was coming from the locked storage closet near his bed. Beep. It was the perfect place for someone to hide.</p>
                    <p>Since beginning the AFA regiment, Robby’s mother, TJ, noticed a change in her son’s demeanor. His anxiety, which had made him a bit of a recluse, had given way to enthusiasm and impassioned speech. Curious, Robby’s father, Robert, wanted to try some–after all, Robby had explained that nootropics were safe. He wanted to see if the substance would boost his memory. Within minutes his heart began to race. He felt euphoric. The sensation lasted only a few hours, but over the next few days, Robert felt terrible. He had strange pinches of pain on different parts of his body. This was clearly not a vitamin for the mind.</p>
                    <p>Robby felt guilty. He didn’t want to hurt his parents. Why had his father reacted like that to the AFA? His parents were going to get back at him for this. They weren’t going to let this go. He couldn’t sleep, terrified of what they were planning. Then Robby remembered the closet. Beep. His family must have hidden his brother, Zach, in the closet. It was obvious that they had flown him up from Florida to jump out of the closet and scare him. That was it! He confided in Jaime.</p>
                    <p>You know that my brother is hiding in the basement closet, right?”</p>
                    <p>She didn’t know, because he wasn’t there. Jaime and TJ tried to show Robby that the closet was safe. Behind the locked door were items from his parents’ old pawn shop–NS no sign of Zach. Some of the boxes contained watches with old batteries. Beep. It was just the sound of batteries dying.</p>

                        Defining what exactly a nootropic is proves complicated. Nootropics include unregulated compounds, unapproved pharmaceutical products and supplements. Some are organic and readily found in nature, and others are synthetic, laboratory-created substances. And though each substance has its own nuances and particulars, what unites all nootropics is their purported ability to help you think clearer and recollect in greater detail.</p>
                    <p> To use a simple analogy, using nootropics is like body building for the brain. Protein powders and work out pills help build muscle and burn fat—or at least that’s the claim. Believers of nootropics argue that the substances work in a similar way—that when you take them, your memory gets stronger and your productivity increases. Some nootropics users say that when taken in the right combination, nootropics help give your brain an edge.</p>
                    <p>Nootropics can be purchased online from specialty vendors, typically in powder form. Users measure out the individual dosage in tiny milligrams and put the ingredients into empty gel capsules for consumption, though sometimes they might mix the powder in water. And for those seeking the brain boost without the hassle, some companies on the market today have created their own blends–all-in-one type pills that remove the guesswork of determining the best ingredients for an individual stack.</p>
                    <p> The term stack is used to describe how users select various nootropics and use them in tandem for specific, targeted effects. Most people who use nootropics are hoping to get, in basic terms, a brain boost. They want to be one step ahead of their competition, able to recollect with greater ease or stay focused for longer than a cup of coffee, Red Bull or Five-Hour Energy might permit. But there are also some who use nootropics to alleviate depression, like Robby, or to cure hangovers. Each user’s motivation and intention is different, but at the core, it’s all centered around improving the brain’s performance.</p>
                    <p> It makes sense that users of nootropics skew young—many are college students seeking a boost to help with overpacked schedules that include full course loads, unpaid internships, extracurriculars and post-college planning. Nootropics have also found a home in Silicon Valley, where the quest for success drives the start-up culture and tech industry. Geoffrey Woo, co-founder of Nootrobox, a mail-order nootropic company that offers monthly supplies of its products, says that his clientele consists of mostly young men in urban locations, namely San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. Jimmy Kenny, founder of Nootropics City, says that his customers also tend to be men between the ages of 18-34 that are invested in the science behind nootropics–think chemistry majors.
                    </p>
                    <p> For students and those attempting to make a name for themselves in cutthroat industries, the quest for increased focus and cognitive abilities, along with the pressure get more done and at a higher degree of efficiency, has created a demand for the prescription drugs Adderall and Ritalin. The drugs are typically prescribed to those with ADHD to treat the effects of the disorder, but in recent years, surveys have indicated that such prescription substance abuse is on the rise.

                    <p>Prescriptions like Adderall and Ritalin, along with nootropics, are all considered cognitive enhancers. However Adderall or Ritalin aren’t considered nootropic. Advocates claim that nootropics lack the adverse side effects of these so-called smart drugs. And that’s partially what makes them so alluring–that you can be more productive and focused without the burn-out or racing heartbeat or crash of stimulants.</p>
                    <p> Nootropics are sometimes referred to as a biohack. Biohacking refers to a systematic approach to self-improvement using various techniques and technologies to enhance the body and mind.
                    </p>
                    <p> “As a biohacker, I’m interested in experimenting with myself,” says Mark Moschel, an organizer of the Chicago Biohacking Meetup community. “It’s about the using the techniques and tools available for collecting personal data, and what you do with that information.”
                    </p>
                    <p> The interests of the biohacking community are varied, and to be sure, not all biohackers use or buy into the hype surrounding nootropics. Some are interested in dietary trends, including the paleo and ergogenic diets or the Bulletproof Diet. More adventurous biohackers may even toy with hormones and electro-magnetic technologies. Even the use of fitness monitoring devices, like FitBit or Apple’s Health app could be defined as biohacking. But what unites biohackers from across the spectrum is their commitment to experimentation–to seeing what’s successful and what isn’t, using their own bodies as research tools.
                    </p>
                    <p> Moschel figures that roughly half of the Chicago Biohacking community’s core group are actively experimenting with nootropics, but the topic remains of interest and relevance, even to members not taking nootropics currently.
                    </p>
                    <p> Like other biohacks, nootropic experimentation often involves a high level of personal experimentation. Users seek to find the correct ratio of different compounds and determine the most effective dose of the stacks they’ve created. And they share the results in order to learn from one another, meaning there’s a communal, community-based aspect to nootropics.
                    </p>
                    <p> The nootropic conversation takes place online, mostly at different forums, including the Nootropics sub-Reddit, Bluelight and Longecity. The Nootropics sub-Reddit, or r/Nootropics, has over 53,000 subscribers. The beginner’s guide post on the sub-Reddit explains 39 different nootropics. It also includes instructions on how to measure powders, what to consider before taking anything new and a list of reliable and blacklisted suppliers of nootropics.
                    </p>
                    <p> The conversation was so active on r/Nootropics that another sub-Reddit, r/StackAdvice, was created to handle the traffic. On r/StackAdvice, users are quick to share positive outcomes of products that produce desired effects, or warn against mixing certain nootropics.

                        Robby couldn’t function. His parents moved him upstairs into Jaime’s room. For a week, he was lost underwater. He saw faces, but couldn’t hear what the faces were saying. Robby wanted to speak, but the words were gone. All the medication he was taking–even the Klonopin and Zoloft–he abruptly stopped. But the drastic change, rather than a slow taper, most likely shocked his system. He struggled to put a coherent thought together. His parents monitored him, taking shifts during the night. Robby went three days without any sleep or much food and water.
                    </p>
                    <p> Robert thought going out for breakfast might help. Robby and his dad got in the truck and drove. At a stop sign, Robby opened the door and tried to bolt. He was so weak he only made it a few steps. He was convinced his dad was giving him the secret signal to run. Robby’s eyes darted back towards the woods, ready to run again. His dad took a step forward, placing his arms around Robby’s shoulders trying to make him feel safe. They both silently got back in the car.
                    </p>
                    <p> TJ and Robert thought it might be time to go to the hospital. They were surprised to hear Robby quietly agree.
                    </p>
                    <p> As Robby sat on the couch tying his shoes, he looked up at his mother blankly. TJ realized just how serious Robby’s state might be. Would he ever come back from this? He could be stuck in a permanent psychosis. Robby sat in the back bench seat of the truck. He couldn’t reach the door, he couldn’t make a break for it.
                    </p>
                    <p> While at the hospital, TJ phoned Zach, Robby’s younger brother, and explained what happened. She listed everything Robby had taken: AFA, Phenibut, tianeptine, Noopept, phenethylamine, Zoloft and Klonopin.
                    </p>
                    <p> Zach wanted to find out everything he could about the substances. He wanted to see if there was a way to reverse what had happened. He turned to Reddit, posting in r/Nootropics and several other drug-related threads, hoping to find someone who had taken a similar stack.
                    </p>
                    <p> The responses were immediate–and alarming.
                    </p>
                    <p> “This guy clearly has a crazy stack, craziest I’ve ever seen.”
                    </p>
                    <p> “He’s really far into something dark.”
                    </p>
                    <p> “OP, your brother is an addict he needs help.”
                    </p>
                    <p> “He isn’t using nootropics, he’s abusing research chemicals.”
                    </p>
                    <p> “Three words: Self-destructive behavior.”
                    </p>
                    <p> TJ scrolling through the responses, numb. She wanted to find advice and suggestions. She had hoped to find reason to believe that Robby’s situation wasn’t permanent. Instead she found strangers debating her son’s mental health. The remarks forced her to confront what she had always suspected. It woke her up to a truth that she had buried and ignored. But she couldn’t be in denial anymore. Her son was an addict, and what he was experimenting with was dangerous.

                        Nootropics are easy to acquire, but legally difficult to classify. That’s because they fall into several different legal categories, depending on the specific substance. Though some are clearly labeled and defined, others are categorized using undefined terms to skirt liability.
                    </p>
                    <p> The nootropics sales landscape is expansive, and vendors include both companies backed by Silicon Valley venture capitalists and small operations that look less-than-reputable. That variance means consumers are required to parse through misleading advertising to find what they consider a reliable source for their desired product.
                    </p>
                    <p> Nootropics that are found in nature, like caffeine, theanine, bacopa, gingko bilboa, and milk thistle, are classified and sold as dietary supplements. They’re available over-the-counter, and in many cases, have been used by homeopathic medicine advocates for decades.
                    </p>
                    <p> However that doesn’t necessarily make them safer, or more reliable. Due to federal legislation, companies that manufacture dietary supplements don’t need Food and Drug Administration approval before producing, marketing or selling supplements–but they are required to register their facilities with the agency.
                    </p>
                    <p> Earlier this year, the New York attorney general’s office sent cease and desist letters to GNC, Target, Walgreens and Walmart–major players in the supplement industry–for selling mislabeled supplements. Some supplements, including Target’s gingko biloba and St. John’s wort, herbs used in some nootropic stacks, didn’t even include significant amounts of the herb they claimed to be on the label. Most tested were found to have ingredients not identified on the labels, including allergens and contaminants.
                    </p>
                    <p> By mandate of the FDA, supplements are legally required to have a disclaimer on all claims. Anyone selling a supplement under the premise that it can effectively cure a treat, diagnose, prevent or cure diseases, then, is in violation of the federal regulation.
                    </p>
                    <p> “Unlike drugs, supplements are not intended to treat, diagnose, prevent or cure diseases,” says Stephen King of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “That means supplements should not make claims, such as ‘reduces arthritic pain’ or ‘treats heart disease.’”
                    </p>
                    <p> But synthetic nootropics, like piracetam, aniracetam, and noopept are currently unscheduled in the United States. Piracetam is one of the most common nootropics, and was the first nootropic synthesized by scientist Corneliu E. Giurgea, who coined the term nootropic in the 1960s. Piracetam was originally tested as a sleep aid, but found to have the opposite effect. The drug isn’t on the market in the United States, but it is prescribed and marketed abroad in various forms. Some of its uses include the treatment of vertigo and alleviation of muscle twitching.
                    </p>
                    <p> Noopept, an analogous drug to piracetam that was in Robby’s daily stack, is sold as a prescription in Russia, but not in the United States. Aniracetam, similar to piracetam, isn’t on the market stateside, either. The FDA has issued an import alert for noopept–meaning it can’t be legally imported. The FDA has also issued warning letters to some sellers of piracetam, claiming they were making false claims.

                    <p>
                        Amfonelic acid, the substance that triggered Robby’s psychosis, is a research compound, uncontrolled by the FDA for sales or consumption, but used in studies as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor–or a drug with psychostimulant properties. It isn’t a nootropic, but it’s discussed routinely on the forums and was even sold to Robby via a nootropics vendor. And it’s also in the same strange, unregulated realm.
                    </p>
                    <p> “It’s in a legal grey area,” says Mans Denton, founder of Hyperion Strength, a supplement company, who previously owned a nootropics company. “It’s not illegal, but it’s in a strange area. You can’t say supplement, you have to say cognitive enhancer or nootropic–which are undefined terms in any legal sense.”
                    </p>
                    <p> And yet, entrepreneurs are taking chances and setting up shop in the nootropic e-commerce space. Take Jimmy Kenny. When Kenny’s brother first clued him into the world of nootropics, he didn’t just see it a panacea–he saw an opportunity.
                    </p>
                    <p> When his younger brother showed him the nootropics sub-Reddit, he surveyed the market and saw nootropics as a trend on the up-and-up. He saw a space that was growing and decided to carve out an opening in the market. Not knowing where to begin, Kenny gathered the resources he had–he cashed out his 401k paid all the associated fees. He took some of his of savings and found a couple of suppliers, at first it was through Alibaba. He read everything he could, uncertain and skeptical, but committed, creating Nootropics City, an online vendor.
                    </p>
                    <p> “I lost all my pride and dignity so I could do this,” Kenny says. “I was single, I had no obligations, so I could.”

                    <p>Because many of the products lie outside the scope of FDA regulations, there’s no independent governmental verification of product safety–which can be intimidating for prospective users aware.
                    </p>
                    <p> As an antidote to skepticism, vendors often self-publish certificates of analysis, or reviews from independently subcontracted laboratories that verify authenticity of product. The r/Nootropics community keeps a running list of independent tests.
                    </p>
                    <p> Such testing may seem suspicious, but according to Lewis Grossman, a professor at American University’s Washington College of Law, such third-party independent analysis is a very common trend in food and drug law. Recent legislation that amended the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Safety Act goes so far as to envision third-party verifications for the federal food safety system due to budgetary restrictions facing the agency. The challenge in years to come will be to maintain the necessary oversight but utilize third-party, independent certifications and inspections, says Grossman.

                    <p>Ultimately the bottom line is simple: There are major risks that users of these substances must consider. They have to judge whether the supplier is actually selling what they claim to be selling, and whether or not to trust the sourcing. And of course, they have to evaluate what taking that substance means for their health.

                        Do nootropics actually work? The outlook is uncertain, but it doesn’t look too promising. The science is murky at best, testing appears to suffer from inherent limitations and a lack of financial incentivization and few scientists are critically engaging in the subject matter. And many nootropics simply haven’t been tested in the way that users are treating them–as a boost rather than a means to remedy a cognitive deficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p> “This has been a much harder question to answer than many advocates assume, in part because of placebo effects, and in part because of the uncertain relevance of performance on laboratory tasks to real-life cognitive performance,” says Dr. Wayne Hall, professor at the University of Queensland and director at the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research.
                    </p>
                    <p> According to Hall, media coverage in recent years has been less critical than desired, and he invites increased scepticism from those covering and considering nootropics. In an editorial in Addiction, the scientific journal published by the Society for the Study of Addiction, Hall and his colleague Jayne Lucke conclude, “There is very weak evidence that putatively neuroenhancing pharmaceuticals in fact enhance cognitive function.”
                    </p>
                    <p> With the type of cognitive testing needed to prove that nootropics do work, it’s particularly difficult to measure results.
                    </p>
                    <p> “It is very hard to study long-term effects on memory because it takes a couple years,” says Dr. Jay Z. Yeh, professor emeritus in pharmacology at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “You won’t be able to see, ‘Oh, I take this drug this week, next week my memory becomes better.’ Nothing works like that. It’s hard to evaluate the effectiveness.”
                    </p>
                    <p> There’s also a level of uncertainty associated with the mechanisms at play.
                    </p>
                    <p> “Anybody who says, ‘I know exactly how this drug works this way,’ is sort of blatantly lying to you,” says Dr. Todd Solomon, a clinical neuropsychology fellow at Boston University.
                    </p>
                    <p> And of course, the drugs have yet to be approved in the United States for use. At an FDA Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Meeting in February 2015, Dr. Kenneth Bergmann presented on piracetam, recommending that it not be placed on the list of bulk substances allowed for compounding, or combining or altering with other substances specifically for a patient’s needs.

                    <p> “The majority of these studies suffer from methodological limitations...and lack scientific validity,” said Bergmann. “They’re often insufficiently powered; just a small study, uncontrolled or unblinded.”
                    </p>
                    <p> Even if nootropics prove effective, there’s the ethical question of cognitive enhancement. Off-brand use of or possession without a prescription of Adderall and Ritalin is a felony–not to mention that the drugs are amphetamine-based stimulants, meaning they can be habit-forming.
                    </p>
                    <p> Where exactly cognitive enhancers lie along the spectrum of social acceptance remains to be seen. Supplements like gingko biloba and St. John’s wort have been used for years, but nootropics are still on the ascent and rising to more mainstream prominence–and many don’t know what to make of the drugs.
                    </p>
                    <p> Madeline Kossik, a chemistry student at Northwestern University, represents many college-aged individuals who face temptation from the drug’s promise of increased focus, but are wary of how they will be perceived.
                    </p>
                    <p> “The idea of being able to take a pill and then being able to focus or get your brain to work better, get more work done and understand things better is really tempting,” Kossik says. “Northwestern’s pre-professional, competitive environment probably has something to do with it.”
                    </p>
                    <p> Kossik is not alone in her quest for heightened and directed focus. According to a study conducted by the Food & Drug Administration, Americans ages 14-21 consume an average of 68.45 mg of caffeine per day. Caffeine intake is universally accepted as a way for individuals to stay awake and focused in their work. Nootropics, on the other hand, are an amplified method of extreme focus and understanding, with much less research done on their composition and effects.

                        A thick, blackish-purple sludge moved through Robby’s veins. At the hospital doctors couldn’t take his blood because of severe dehydration. After two saline drips, nurses drew blood samples and gave Robby a dose of Ativan so he could finally sleep. Later that afternoon, Robby awoke. Lucid, he realized what had happened to him.
                    </p>
                    <p> “I felt like I’d been dragged through hell,” says Robby. “If someone had come to kill me, I would have told them to do it now. I was never afraid of dying, but right then, it was so heavy.”
                    </p>
                    <p> Jaime came to the hospital. Robby was awake and craving a cigarette. His family, with a watchful eye, helped Robby sneak out for a smoke with Jaime. Standing together, Jaime saw the real Robby. That cigarette was a taste of normalcy. He was there; he was coming back. He wasn’t locked behind paranoia and fear. Robby came home from hospital, with family relieved and hopeful it was now behind them. But TJ had an unsettling, nagging feeling that it wasn’t over yet.
                    </p>
                    <p> Robby’s family is open to homeopathic solutions. They tend to shy away from medication, even aspirin, and favor natural remedies when available. And that’s one reason why they trusted nootropics. Robby did hours of research on receptors in the brain, investigating neurotransmitters and how each substance reacts in the body. But with AFA, he experimented with the unknown. When his mother conducted her research online, she found an appalling lack of information.
                    </p>
                    <p> “I read things that said you don’t even want to be in the room when the jar is open,” TJ said. “Breathing or touching it could give you a reaction. And that, that was the end of it.”
                    </p>
                    <p> TJ watched Robby flush the rest of the AFA down the toilet. It was all gone. It was out of their lives–except for the tiny amount Robby had stashed away. A few days after his stay at the hospital, Robby and his mom started to debate whether AFA was really the cause of his psychosis. TJ knew it was dangerous, but Robby wanted to prove his mom wrong. He retrieved the AFA he stashed and took it–and went into a state of psychosis again. It wasn’t as bad as before, but Robby couldn’t sleep. He was scared to close his eyes. TJ promised him he would be okay, and that she wouldn’t leave him. Robby slept a few hours while his mom stayed up, watching him, worried sick if he’d be able to cross back into reality.
                    </p>
                    <p> TJ isn’t convinced that the AFA hasn’t done permanent damage, believing it’s still too soon to tell. Robby, meanwhile, is still recovering from everything that’s happened. He still has mild moments of paranoia thoughts and spells of anxiety, but TJ is there to calm him down. He doesn’t live in the basement anymore. He sleeps in his fiance’s room and spends most of the time in the main areas of his family’s house, where he can interact with Jaime–and where TJ can watch him more closely. Robby has started to see an addiction counselor, and TJ monitors all of his medication.
                    </p>
                    <p> “Nootropics are great, I just made the mistake of not researching enough before I took it,” said Robby.
                    </p>
                    <p> Robby still takes Zoloft and Klonopin, but has reduced the amount and dosages of nootropics he takes–just phenibut and tianeptine, and at the lowest dose, just few milligrams of each.
                    </p>
                    <p> “You wouldn’t turn teenagers over to a pharmacy and say, ‘Have at it!’” said TJ. “You can’t do that with nootropics either.”
                    </p>
                    <p> But in a sense, that’s exactly what happening. Anyone with a credit card can buy these substances online and get next day shipping. The market for nootropics is a wide open one, with advertising geared towards young adults seeking to jump ahead of everyone else. And though users cite scientific literature, most turn to online forums for advice—advice which comes in the the form of wildly variable self-conducted experiments and individual subjective reports. There’s no extensive, long-term data or research on the use of nootropics on healthy, non-cognitively deficient patients, meaning there’s no real confirmation of the benefits or harm of the way the Reddit guinea pigs are using nootropics.
                    </p>
                    <p> In the world of nootropics, the scales teeter between dangerous or safe, effective or not. No one can say for sure what potential for harm—or good—will result from nootropics usage. But at present, it’s a growing open source experiment undertaken by anyone with an Internet connection, a credit card with change to spare, a shipping address and an appetite for unknowable risk.
