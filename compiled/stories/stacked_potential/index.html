						The cult of nootropics promises that the drugs will sharpen your mind and unlock your true cognitive potential. And though few studies have demonstrated the drugs’ efficacy, believers from Reddit and beyond are singing their praises. Are the drugs truly a safe smart drug, or nothing more than snake oil?

						<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he answer landed in his mailbox early one morning in Edwardsburg, Michigan. The small UPS package held
						 Robby Walker’s chance at a life outside his bedroom.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-4"></div>
					<div class="col-md-7">
						<p>Robby walked downstairs to his room in the basement.  Immediately he cut open the box from NewMind and 
						reached inside.  In his palm he held a clear plastic bag with .25 grams of pale yellow powder called 
						amfonelic acid.  It was supposed to boost dopamine levels.  It was supposed to be safe, with no risk of 
						addiction and no side effects.</p>
						 
						<p>Using a diamond scale Robby measured out 1 milligram–roughly the weight of a small ant–of the AFA powder, pouring it into an empty gel capsule.  He monitored his body’s response, paying close attention to any physiological changes.  He noticed nothing suspect; he felt just fine.  The next day, he measured out 10 milligrams.  AFA was the newest addition to his daily regiment:   Tianeptine 200mg twice a day, Noopept Xmg in the morning, Xmg of Phenethylamine as needed and 450mg of Phenibut before bed.  In addition he took Zoloft and Klonopin, both prescribed by his doctors.  The combination helped Robby manage his anxiety and depression–and it was a lot better than the amphetamines and opioids he was abusing just a year ago.</p>
						 
						<p>When Robby told his doctors about the other substances he was taking, most of them had never heard of nootropics.  Robby told his doctors what he took, and they advised him to keep an eye on how they made him feel–if they seemed to work, it was fine.  The nootropics Robby tried helped him take control of his life.  He held his longest job thanks to them.  They helped draw out a side of Robby his depression and anxiety kept hidden–the Robby that was relaxed, thoughtful, engaging and funny.  He’d cook dinner for his fiancé, Jaime, or rub her feet after a long day at work.</p>
						 
						<p>But the depression lingered.  After a few days of taking AFA, Robby increased his dose to 20mgs.  He didn’t notice any negative side effects, but Jaime could see how it was affecting him.  He made big hand gestures.  He talked quickly.  His heart raced.</p>
						 
						<p>Robby placed another order for AFA from NewMind, this time for 1 gram.  It cost him 150 dollars.  That week he upped the dosage to 60mg of AFA, then bumped it up again to 80mg.  Robby started sleeping less, maybe three hours a night or so.  But he wasn’t concerned.  He was a night owl, anyway, spending hours researching nootropics online and getting lost in dark corners of the Internet.</p>
						 
						<p>One of those nights, Robby was laying in bed.  Beep.  It was soft and quick, like a tiny prick in his ears.  Beep.  He heard it again.  Was he really alone in the basement?  Beep.  It was coming from the locked storage closet near his bed.  Beep.  His parents kept old items from their pawn shop in there.  It was the perfect place for someone to hide.  Beep.</p>
						 
						<p>What if a substance you simply swallowed each morning could lead to increased memory, energy and alertness–without any adverse side effects? But what if its long-term effects hadn’t yet been fully tested–or even understood–within the medical community?</p>
						 
						<p>For those experimenting with nootropic drugs, the promises of a smarter, better self and clearer, enhanced mind are worth the unknown risks and the uncertain long-term side effects. And as the substances become increasingly popular, suppliers and vendors are seeking to meet the demand of users–while navigating the murky waters of FDA regulation of nutritional supplements.</p>

<h3>Noo-What?</h3>
 
<p>Nootropics are, broadly speaking, cognitive enhancers. Cognitive enhancers are a category of pharmaceuticals that seek to treat cognitive deficiencies in patients, like the speaking or problem-solving  difficulties triggered by a stroke or the onset of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
 
<p>The phrase nootropic can refer to a whole host of substances. Romanian scientist Corneliu E. Giurgea coined the phrase nootropic in the 1970s to describe what he considered a new class of drugs that he believed would improve learning and memory, lack the side effects of stimulants or sedatives, and have neuronal protective qualities–meaning, they would work while preserving brain cell functioning.</p>
 
<p>But not all cognitive enhancers are nootropics. Take, for instance, Adderall, Ritalin, or Modafinil. All are commonly referred to as smart drugs, but all have potentially adverse side effects. Some argue that they do boost memory, but the drugs all lack the neuroprotective qualities that are required to be considered nootropic, according to Giurgea’s definition.</p>
 
<p>Nootropics can be either naturally-occurring substances, like vitamins and herbs, or synthetic compounds. One of the most common–and the first–synthetic nootropic drug is piracetam, a drug initially synthesized in the 1960s by Giurgea. Piracetam was originally tested as a sleep aid, but found to have the opposite effect. The drug isn’t on the market in the United States, but it is prescribed abroad for the treatment of vertigo and muscle twitching. Piracetam is marketed as Nootropil by UCB Pharma, a pharmaceutical company based in Belgium.</p>
 
<p>Nootropics have been studied scientifically and sold pharmaceutically since then, but the recent uptick in interest in the drug stems, at least in part, thanks to Hollywood. In the 2011 film Limitless, Bradley Cooper’s character begins to experiment with a fictitious nootropic drug called NZT-48, with astonishing results–Cooper’s character is able to learn faster and recall information with ease. In the 2014 film Lucy starring Scarlett Johansson, a fictitious nootropic called CPH4 gives the protagonist access to previously untapped brain capacity.</p>
 
<p>And for many–including college students–the quest for increased focus and cognitive abilities has created a demand for the prescription drugs Adderall and Ritalin. The drugs are typically prescribed to those with ADHD to treat the effects of the disorder, but in recent years, surveys have indicated that such prescription substance abuse is on the rise.</p>
 
<p>In findings published in the Journal of American College Health, of students surveyed, two-thirds were offered prescription stimulants for nonmedical use by their senior year, and 31 percent had used. Survey data from the 2012 Partnership Attitude Tracking Study indicates that one in eight teenagers now misuse or abuse Ritalin or Adderall at least once in their lifetime.
To be clear, nootropics don’t work like Adderall–and even industry insiders think that type of portrayal is misguided.</p>
 
<p>“A lot of people compare nootropics to Adderall or amphetamines, but that shatters the expectation,” says Jimmy Kenny, the founder and chief executive officer of the site Nootropics City.</p>
 
<p>Rather, nootropics offer subtle, more nuanced changes, according to Kenny.</p>

<p>“They makes you more of who you are,” he said. “They help you to achieve whatever goal you’re striving for, whether that’s adapting to environmental stimulation or being able to sit down and read your textbook.”</p>
 
<p>Users of nootropics today typically combine various powders and supplements to create stacks, or combinations, that are meant to boost one’s own abilities.</p>
 
<p>“I take 30 to 40 supplements a day, minimum,” says Eric Matzner, founder of Nootroo, a once-daily nootropic capsule.</p>
 
<p>As for who’s taking nootropics…</p>
 
<p>According to Geoffrey Woo, co-founder of Nootrobox, a mail-order nootropic company that offers monthly supplies of its products akin to Birchbox and NatureBox, “</p>
 
<p>The conversation surrounding nootropics takes place primarily on a number of online forums, including LongeCity and the Nootropics subReddit.</p>
 
<p>Advocates of nootropics sometimes refer to the drugs as a biohack. Biohacking refers to a systematic approach to self-improvement using various techniques and technologies to enhance health and biological functioning. And as more and more people begin to experiment more rigorously with their bodies, it makes sense that they’d be interested in boosting their minds.</p>
 
<p>“As a biohacker, I’m interested in experimenting with myself,” says Mark Moschel, an organizer of the Chicago Biohacking Meetup community. “It’s about the using the techniques and tools available for collecting personal data, and what you do with that information,” says Moschel.</p>
 
<p>The interests of the biohacking community are varied. Biohackers also coalesce in various online forums, like the Quantified Self community or the Bulletproof forum. Some are interested in dietary trends, including the paleo and ergogenic diets or the Bulletproof Diet. More adventurous biohackers may even toy with hormones and electro-magnetic technologies. And even the use of fitness monitoring devices, like FitBit or Apple’s Health app could be defined as biohacking. But what unites biohackers from across the spectrum is their commitment to experimentation.</p>
 
<p>“Biohackers take the information and say, ‘Let’s experiment, try things, see and see what’s successful and what isn’t,’” says Moschel.</p>
 
<p>And though not all members of the Chicago Biohacking community are actively take nootropics—Moschel figures that roughly half of the community’s core group are actively experimenting—the topic remains of interest and relevance to members.</p>
 
<p>Like other biohacks, nootropic experimentation often involves a high level of personal experimentation. Users seek to find the correct ratio of different compounds and determine the most effective dose of the stacks they’ve created.</p>
 
<p>“With nootropics, there’s an excitement factor,” says Moschel. “I can achieve a better level of performance by trying something new.”</p>
 
<p>For some, the user-controlled nature of nootropic experimentation makes the risk feel mitigated. Even so, Moschel remains skeptical.</p>
 
<p>“I’ve tried nootropics and have experimented some myself, but I’m on the fence about the long term effects,” he says. “I’d like to see a lot more research come along before taking the long term risk.”</p>
